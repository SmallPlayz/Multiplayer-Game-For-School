# Multiplayer Game For School
In Computer Science class we were assigned to create a *videogame*. We could use the starter code given or start from scratch. I decided I could make this videogame on my own with no starter code.
## Information
### Why did you start from scratch?
I love the idea of making things from scratch, because you can truly say, *"I made this"*. Also the starter code given to us in class comes with a jar file which has to be imported into the code and I don't think its a good idea to try debugging a jar file I did not create nor am familiar with.
### Why are there only four players?
As someone who spends *way* too long programming, you have to learn to know your limits and capibilities. Personally I was not 100% sure if I could make one client which would let multiple people play with the same client. Instead I wrote 4 seperate clients and a server to work together.
### Will you continue this?
*No. Probibly not.*

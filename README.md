# Multiplayer Game For School
In Computer Science class we were assigned to create a *videogame*. We could use the starter code given or start from scratch. I decided I could make this videogame on my own with no starter code.
## Information
### Description of game:
My game is a simple 2D Multiplayer shooter game. With the server running and 3 other people, you can all play together. Each player has a character on screen that they can control from their computer using a keyboard. Directions and controls can be found in a GUI pop up when the code is ran. If, the code provided in this repository is ran and is unsuccessful, The video provided on the classroom should supply. Note that the game will slow down if you have multiple clients and the server running on the same computer as it might use up to 600mb of ram.
### Why did you start from scratch?
I love the idea of making things from scratch, because you can truly say, *"I made this"*. Also the starter code given to us in class comes with a jar file which has to be imported into the code and I don't think its a good idea to try debugging a jar file I did not create nor am familiar with.
### Why are there only four players?
As someone who spends *way* too long programming, you have to learn to know your limits and capibilities. Personally I was not 100% sure if I could make one client which would let multiple people play with the same client. Instead I wrote 4 seperate clients and a server to work together.
### Will you continue this?
*No. Probibly not.*
